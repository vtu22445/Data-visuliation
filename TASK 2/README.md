## Visualizations Created

### 1. Categorical Data Analysis (`categorical_analysis.png`)

#### Bar Charts:
- **Crop Type Distribution** - Shows frequency of each crop type
- **Season Distribution** - Shows frequency of Summer vs Winter crops

#### Pie Charts:
- **Crop Type Distribution** - Percentage breakdown of crop types
- **Season Distribution** - Percentage breakdown of seasons

### 2. Continuous Data Analysis (`continuous_analysis.png`)

#### Scatter Plots:
- **Area vs Yield** - Relationship between cultivated area and total yield
- **Temperature vs Yield per Hectare** - Relationship between temperature and yield efficiency

#### Line Plots:
- **Temperature by Crop Type** - Average temperature for each crop type
- **Market Price Trends by Year** - Average market price trends over time

#### Strip Plots:
- **Yield per Hectare by Crop Type** - Distribution of yield efficiency across crop types

#### Swarm Plots:
- **Market Price by Crop Type** - Distribution of market prices across crop types

#### Histograms:
- **Yield per Hectare Distribution** - Frequency distribution of yield efficiency
- **Precipitation Distribution with Rug Plot** - Frequency distribution of precipitation with rug plot overlay

#### Density Plots:
- **Temperature Distribution** - Probability density of temperature values

## Key Insights from the Analysis

### Categorical Data Insights:
1. **Crop Distribution**: Corn is the most common crop (34 records), followed by Soybeans (28 records)
2. **Seasonal Pattern**: Summer crops dominate (72 records vs 14 winter records)
3. **Geographic Distribution**: California has the most records (6), with most states having 4 records
4. **Climate Zones**: Continental climate is most common (52 records)
5. **Irrigation**: Flood irrigation is the primary method (80 records)

### Continuous Data Insights:
1. **Yield Efficiency**: Most crops show consistent yield per hectare patterns
2. **Area-Yield Relationship**: Strong positive correlation between area and total yield
3. **Market Dynamics**: Negative correlation between yield and market price
4. **Revenue Patterns**: Total revenue strongly correlates with area and yield

## Statistical Summary
