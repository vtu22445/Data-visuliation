### 3. Line Graphs (Time Series Analysis)
- **Purpose**: Analyze trends over time (2020-2021)
- **Subplots**:
  - Total yield by crop type over years
  - Average yield per hectare by top states
  - Total revenue by climate zone
  - Weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) trends

### 4. Stacked Bar Charts
- **Purpose**: Show composition and distribution across multiple categorical variables
- **Subplots**:
  - Yield by crop type and state
  - Revenue by climate zone and season
  - Area by soil type and irrigation type
  - Fertilizer usage by pest level and disease incidence

### 5. Correlation Heatmap (Bonus)
- **Purpose**: Visualize correlation matrix between numerical variables
- **Features**: Color-coded correlation strength with numerical values

## Key Insights from the Analysis

### Crop Performance:
- Corn shows the highest yield per hectare (7.0 tonnes)
- Soybeans have consistent yield across different regions
- Wheat performs better in winter seasons

### Regional Patterns:
- Iowa and Illinois lead in total agricultural revenue
- Mediterranean climate zones show different patterns than Continental zones
- Temperature and precipitation significantly impact yield efficiency

### Environmental Factors:
- Higher fertilizer usage correlates with increased yield
- Pest infestation and disease incidence affect storage losses
- Climate zones influence crop selection and performance
